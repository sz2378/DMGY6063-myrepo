This is a final project for Creative Coding written by James Zhong

This audio visualizer detects frequencies and beats, and sample 
data which is then used to create graphics.

At the begining, one of the 5 modes will be selected randomly. You can turn it off by pressing the corresponding button (1-5 and 0).

Please use number keys 1-5 and 0 to turn on/off each graphic effect.

To change the audio, save the designated audio file in the /data/
folder and replace the audio name below--besure to include the file-
type suffix.

Also, feel free to change the sensitivity of the beat detector according to the vibe of your song. Default is 30 ms. See comment in the file for more info.
