**Project Description:**


* This is a final project for Creative Coding written by James Zhong

* This audio visualizer is based on the .minim library, which is needed for the program to run properly.

* This audio visualizer detects frequencies and beats, and sample data which is then used to create graphics.

* At the begining, one of the 5 modes will be selected randomly. You can turn it off by pressing the corresponding button (1-5 and 0).

*  __Please use number keys 1-5 and 0 to turn on/off each graphic effect.__

* To change the audio, save the designated audio file in the /data/folder and replace the audio name below; be sure to include the file-type suffix.

* Also, feel free to change the sensitivity of the beat detector according to the vibe of your song. 
Default is 30 ms. See comments in the .pde file for more info.
